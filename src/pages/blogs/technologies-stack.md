# Technologies and Libraries Iâ€™ve Worked With

In my journey as a front-end developer, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies, libraries, and tools. Here's a detailed look at the ones I find most impactful:

## 1. **Astro**

Astro is a modern static site builder that offers a unique approach to front-end development. With Astro, I can create fast, optimized websites using modern frameworks like React and Svelte. Its emphasis on performance and developer experience makes it a favorite in my toolkit.

## 2. **React**

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I have extensive experience creating dynamic and responsive web applications using React. Its component-based architecture allows for modular and maintainable code.

## 3. **JavaScript & TypeScript**

JavaScript is the backbone of web development, and I use it extensively to create interactive elements on web pages. Additionally, TypeScript adds type safety to my JavaScript code, making it easier to catch errors early and maintain large codebases.

## 4. **Three.js**

Three.js is a JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D graphics in the browser. It enables me to add interactive 3D elements to my projects, enhancing the user experience with visually stunning graphics.

## 5. **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**

GSAP is a robust JavaScript library for creating high-performance animations. I use GSAP to bring my projects to life with smooth, professional-grade animations.

## 6. **Core-js**

Core-js is a modular standard library for JavaScript that includes polyfills for ECMAScript features. It helps ensure my code is compatible with various environments and browsers.

## 7. **Vite, Parcel & Webpack**

These are tools for bundling and building JavaScript applications. Vite offers a fast and modern development experience with its lightning-fast hot module replacement. Parcel provides a zero-configuration build tool, simplifying the development process. Webpack is highly configurable and suited for large projects, offering comprehensive features for module bundling.

## 8. **PostCSS, Sass, SCSS & Less**

These are CSS preprocessors and tools that extend the capabilities of CSS with variables, nesting, and mixins. PostCSS allows me to use modern CSS features and maintain compatibility with older browsers. Sass, SCSS, and Less help me write cleaner and more maintainable stylesheets.

## 9. **Basic Knowledge of PHP and C**

In addition to my front-end expertise, I have basic knowledge of PHP and C. PHP is a widely-used server-side scripting language that is especially suited for web development. C is a powerful general-purpose programming language that provides a strong foundation for understanding computer science concepts and developing performance-critical applications.

## Conclusion

The technologies and libraries I've listed here form the core of my front-end development toolkit. Each has its strengths and use cases, and together they enable me to build robust, scalable, and visually appealing web applications. As the web development landscape continues to evolve, I remain committed to learning and adopting new tools and technologies to stay at the forefront of the industry.
