# Technologies and Libraries Iâ€™ve Worked With

In my journey as a front-end developer, I've had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies, libraries, and tools. Here's a detailed look at the ones I find most impactful:

## 1. **Astro**

Astro is a modern static site builder that offers a unique approach to front-end development. With Astro, I can create fast, optimized websites using modern frameworks like React and Svelte. Its emphasis on performance and developer experience makes it a favorite in my toolkit.

## 2. **React**

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I have extensive experience creating dynamic and responsive web applications using React. Its component-based architecture allows for modular and maintainable code.

### Libraries and Tools in React:

- **Redux:** For state management in complex applications.
- **React Router:** For handling routing in single-page applications.
- **Formik:** For building and managing forms in React.
- **React Query:** For fetching, caching, and updating server state in React applications.

## 3. **Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows me to rapidly build custom user interfaces. Its utility classes simplify styling and enable a consistent design across projects. I frequently use Tailwind to ensure my applications are both visually appealing and responsive.

## 4. **JavaScript & TypeScript**

JavaScript is the backbone of web development, and I use it extensively to create interactive elements on web pages. Additionally, TypeScript adds type safety to my JavaScript code, making it easier to catch errors early and maintain large codebases.

## 5. **HTML5 & CSS3**

HTML5 and CSS3 are fundamental to web development. I use HTML5 to structure web content semantically and CSS3 for styling, animations, and responsive design.

## 6. **Git & GitHub**

Version control is crucial for any development workflow. I use Git for version control and GitHub for collaboration and code hosting. This allows me to track changes, manage code repositories, and collaborate with other developers efficiently.

## 7. **Next.js**

Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. It offers features like file-based routing and API routes, which make it easier to build full-stack applications.

## 8. **GraphQL**

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows for more efficient data fetching. I use GraphQL to build flexible and powerful APIs, improving the performance and scalability of my applications.

## 9. **Webpack & Vite**

Both Webpack and Vite are tools for bundling and building JavaScript applications. Webpack is highly configurable and suited for large projects, while Vite offers a fast and modern development experience with its lightning-fast hot module replacement.

## 10. **Testing Libraries**

Testing is an essential part of development to ensure code quality and reliability. I use various testing libraries and frameworks, including:

- **Jest:** For unit testing JavaScript and React applications.
- **React Testing Library:** For testing React components.
- **Cypress:** For end-to-end testing of web applications.

## 11. **Node.js & Express**

On the backend, I use Node.js and Express to build server-side applications and APIs. This allows me to handle server-side logic, manage databases, and integrate with other services.

## 12. **MongoDB & Firebase**

For database management, I have experience with both MongoDB, a NoSQL database, and Firebase, a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform. These tools help me manage data efficiently and provide real-time updates to my applications.

## 13. **Figma & Adobe XD**

For UI/UX design, I use tools like Figma and Adobe XD to create wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity designs. These tools enable me to visualize and iterate on designs before implementation.

## 14. **CI/CD Tools**

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) are vital for maintaining the quality and reliability of applications. I use tools like GitHub Actions and Jenkins to automate testing and deployment processes.

## Conclusion

The technologies and libraries I've listed here form the core of my front-end development toolkit. Each has its strengths and use cases, and together they enable me to build robust, scalable, and visually appealing web applications. As the web development landscape continues to evolve, I remain committed to learning and adopting new tools and technologies to stay at the forefront of the industry.
